# Clean Architecutre Kit

## Introduction
Clean Architecture Kit is a sophisticated .NET 8 backend framework designed with a focus on clean architecture principles. This repository serves as a comprehensive toolkit for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable services and business logic for various projects. This repository brings a way of structuring the application so that the business object is encapsulated at the heart of the application, making it independent from implementation details.

This repository will give us the best in terms of testable, maintainable, and scalable code. It's based heavily on separation of concerns. 

## Key Features
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensures each class or module in the application has a single, well-defined responsibility.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Promotes loose coupling between modules, enhancing maintainability and testability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct separation between the different concerns of the application, such as UI, business logic, and data access.
- **CQRS with MediatR Pattern**: Implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation with the MediatR pattern for clear separation between read and write operations.
- **Fluent API Design**: Provides a more readable and concise way to configure and initialize objects.
- **Efficient Caching Mechanisms**: Implements advanced caching strategies to improve performance and scalability.
- Additional features include [list other features like domain-driven design, event sourcing, etc., if applicable].
